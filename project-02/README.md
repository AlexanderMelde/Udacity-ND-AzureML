# Operationalizing Machine Learning

## Overview
This project is part of the [Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-for-microsoft-azure-nanodegree--nd00333).
In this project, we configure and deploy a cloud-based machine learning production model using Azure and then consume it

Parts of the code are taken from the [official repository for this project](https://github.com/udacity/nd00333_AZMLND_C2/tree/master/starter_files).

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model".

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

A detailed log of all executed steps and responses can be seen in the notebook [udacity-project.ipynb](udacity-project.ipynb).


## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
